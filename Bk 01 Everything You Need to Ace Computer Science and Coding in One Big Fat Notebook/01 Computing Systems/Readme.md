# Unit 1 - Computing Systems

## What is computer science

- Study of computers and how computer technology can be used solve problems
- Computing system: All basic hardware + software

### Five concept areas of computer science

1. Computing systems: machines that run programs and process information (pc, phone, laptop)
2. Algorithms and programming
   - Algorithms: list of steps of instructions
   - Program: a set of instruction
3. Data and A: Pronalysis
   - Collection, storing, organizing, studing facts => help us understand what data mean
4. Networks and the Internet
   - Networks: a group of connected devices
   - Internet: The worldwide network that connects millions of computers
5. Impacts of Computing
   - Studying how computers influence our lives, culture, etc.

## What is a computer

- Stores, shares and analyzes huge amounts of data

### Parts of a whole

#### 1. Hardware

- Input: send information to a computer (keyboard, mouse, game controller)
- Storage
- Processing: interpret input, supply output
  - CPU (Central processing unit): Receive input => executes commands from other hardware and software
    - main memory
    - control unit
    - ALU (arithmetic logic unit)
  - GPU (Graphics processing unit)
    - delivers images, animation, videos
- Output: the parts that the computer uses to send information to you

#### 2. Software

- Application software (Apps): Programs that allow the user to complete task
- System software: make sure the individual hardware devices work together and properly with other programs.

## How do we interact with Computers

### Human-computer interaction

- User interface: visual interface used by a user to interact with a computer, device or software application
- Graphical user interface: a type of user interface that uses icons and symbols on a screen instead of just plain text
- Command-line interface

### Troubleshooting

- Using systematic approach to solving error within a computing system or software.
- Debugging: specific form of troubleshooting that is used when programming

#### Troubleshooting Stategies

- Swapping in working parts from other computers
- Creating a diagram to trace the problem
- See if the hardware will work
- Checking software settings and the compatibility
- Troubleshooter
