## Recursion

- Recursive defination: thing that is being defined as part of the defination
- Recursive method: A method that call itself
- Important rules
  - base case:
    - conditional statement that has a return
    - can be handled without a base case
  - must be applied to small problem, the problem is smaller each time the method is called until this equal to the base case
- Pros:
  - compact, elegent code
  - easier to understand
