# Classes and Objects

## Design a class

- Think about:
  - Things the object knows: instance variables => present state of object
  - Things the object does: methods => present behavior of object
- Think of instance as another way of saying object: objects have instance variables and methods, but those instance variables and methods are designed as part of the class.

## Differnce between a class and an object

- A class is not an object (but itâ€™s used to construct them)
