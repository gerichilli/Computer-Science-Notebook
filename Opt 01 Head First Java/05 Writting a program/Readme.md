# Writting a program

## Test-driven development (TDD)

- Write the test code first
- Develop in iteration cycles
- Keep the code simple
- Refactor whenever and wherever you notice the opportunity
- Don't release anything until it passes all the tests
- Don't put in anything that's not in the spec
- No killer schedules; work regular hours.
